Requirements: flask and pytorch (torch)

The original tests and ideas are in og.py and og2.py. 

The main genetic algorithm, just the algorithm and nothing else with all my comments, is in genetic.py.

For some reason I can't push to github from my machine right now because my "email isn't verified" even though it is so I had to upload it kind of weird. So, in order to run the website, make a new folder called "templates" with index.html and result.html in it, and then run app.py. Then the website will be running on localhost:8501. 

For testing I used test_brute.py and test_genetic.py.
